One night, ǂṴʼulaã awoke because of the distant wail of a hurt beast. He filled up his canteen and tipped his arrows, and began tracking the sound by moonlight. After he'd ran for long along the tracks of his prey, he finally caught up to it. However, ǂṴʼulaã discovered that there was no hurt animal which he could skin for meat: there was only a mongoose, snickering at him. The Night had transformed into a mongoose to make fun of the hunter.

The Night said to him: "What will you hunt, now that there is nothing for you to gain?" and laughed, and laughed.

ǂṴʼulaã shot a poisoned arrow to the mongoose, and she died. He told to the Night:

"Thank you for the gift you provide in death: little meat of value, but a great lightness of heart."

And so, this is how the Sun slew the Night, and begot Dawn. And all hunters after hunted by day.
